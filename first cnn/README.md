# CIFAR-10 Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.

## Overview

The project includes:
- Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Defining a CNN model
- Training the model with an Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduler
- Evaluating the model's performance
- total accuracy was 67%

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `tqdm`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib pandas tqdm
